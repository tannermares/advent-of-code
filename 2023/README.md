## 2023
My goal for 2023 was to solve each of the days with both JavaScript and Ruby. Initially converting the functional/procedural solution directly from Ruby to JS. Then, refactoring the Ruby solution to use Objects and use a more OOP approach.

I've added some specs to aid in the refactoring so I wouldn't have to actually compare the output of the scripts to the expected answer.
