## 2024

My goal for 2024 was to solve each of the days with both Ruby and JavaScript. Initially converting the functional/procedural solution directly. Then, maybe refactoring the Ruby solution to use Objects and use a more OOP approach.

I've added some specs to aid in the refactoring so I wouldn't have to actually compare the output of the scripts to the expected answer.

### Progress
